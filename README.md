# Machine Learning for Water Quality Analysis

Introduction:
The analysis of water quality stands as a significant domain within the realm of machine learning research, often referred to as water potability analysis.
This endeavor revolves around comprehending the myriad factors influencing water safety and devising machine learning models capable of discerning the suitability of specific water samples for consumption.
In this pursuit, a Kaggle dataset brimming with essential parameters impacting water potability serves as our foundation. 
Given the criticality of each factor in assessing water quality, a meticulous exploration of the dataset's features precedes the training of machine learning algorithms aimed at predicting the safety of water samples.
